# Golden-Age-TV-Data-Analysis
This project explores data from the entertainment industry, focusing on TV shows during the “Golden Age” of television (1999–present). The main goal is to investigate whether highly-rated TV shows also receive the most IMDb votes — testing the assumption that audience engagement (votes) correlates with higher ratings.
Dataset Description

The dataset contains records of movies and TV shows from IMDb, including details about titles, genres, contributors, and ratings.

- Validate or reject the initial assumption
