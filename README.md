# Golden-Age-TV-Data-Analysis
This project explores data from the entertainment industry, focusing on TV shows during the “Golden Age” of television (1999–present). The main goal is to investigate whether highly-rated TV shows also receive the most IMDb votes — testing the assumption that audience engagement (votes) correlates with higher ratings.
